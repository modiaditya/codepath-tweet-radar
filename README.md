## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Seperation of concerns between Fragments, Activities and Adapters
- Passing listeners/callbacks between Activities, Fragments and Adapters
- Understanding the scroll behavior of Coordinator Layout and how it affects its children remains a mystery 

## Open-source libraries used

- [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) - Simple asynchronous HTTP requests with JSON parsing
- [Picasso](http://square.github.io/picasso/) - Image loading and caching library for Android

* [x] Move the "Compose" action to a [FloatingActionButton](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Floating-Action-Buttons) instead of on the AppBar.
* [x] On the Twitter timeline, leverage the [CoordinatorLayout](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Handling-Scrolls-with-CoordinatorLayout#responding-to-scroll-events) to apply scrolling behavior that [hides / shows the toolbar](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll).
* [x] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [ ] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [x] Enable your app to [receive implicit intents](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Intents-to-Create-Flows#receiving-implicit-intents) from other apps.  When a link is shared from a web browser, it should pre-fill the text and title of the web page when composing a tweet.

## Notes

### Challenges

* Working `android-oauth-handler` can be challening since its sort of a black box. There were a few things I could not, like if the Main Activity was anything but Login Activity, and then if I called Login Activity, it would throw exceptions when trying to authorize the user
* Coordinator layout scroll behavior is very tricky to understand. I still dont get it
* Working with twitter API rate limit can be challenging since there was so much I wanted to do if the limit was not there
